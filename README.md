# MyTutor

Fully Functional Tutoring application built with Node.js and SQLite3. This application allows users to view different tutors and their subjects, and also allows users to sign up and login to book a tutor.

## Installation and Use

- Run `npm install` on your terminal to install all dependencies.

- Run `npm run devStart` to initialize the server locally. The server will then be hosted on port 3000 by default, meaning you can access MyTutor by visiting "http://localhost:3000/" on your web browser after starting the server.

All data is stored on ./data/database.db by default.
